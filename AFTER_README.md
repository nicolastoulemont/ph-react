Thanks for the test, I enjoyed it.

I wish that I had enough time left to do the following:

- do the optional task (I choose to write this instead of rushing the last task in 2min)
- Write some tests
- Go to my go-to tools instead of discovering something new in a stressy situation, I think I wasted 20min with localforage before switching the `useLocalStorage` hook of the `react-use` lib
- provider UX overall, both the styling and the UX of this test output are really poor, and I'm sorry for it :D, I had more time I would:
  - Drag & drop to move image from folder to folder (react-dnd would be a good lib for it)
  - Editable folder titles (for the last task)
  - Keep the UploadForm button visible at all time, there is no point in hiding to show the result image anymore since they are visible in the image list
  - Have better styles overall, I barely wrote any css.
